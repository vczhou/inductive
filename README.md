hello i don't know how markdown works.
to install make sure you have python >= 3.6 and pip3 installed. 

i highly recommend installing a virtualenv, so look up python virtual env

to install,

start up your virtualenv
and then run 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

after this go to inductive and run
```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py runserver
```
